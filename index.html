            <strong>Smart cities</strong> aren’t just a concept or a dream of the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks to the wildly innovative <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot" title="The Internet of Things" target="_blank">Internet of Things (IoT) solutions</a>, many are already active and expanding rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Municipal governments are leveraging cellular and Low Power Wide Area (LPWAN) wireless technologies to connect and improve infrastructure, efficiency, convenience, and quality of life for residents and visitors alike.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's dive in.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What is a smart city?
        </h2>

        <div class="banner1">
            <p>
                <strong>A smart city is a framework</strong>, predominantly composed of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), to develop, deploy, and promote sustainable development practices to address growing urbanization challenges. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            A big part of this ICT framework is an intelligent network of connected objects and machines (also known as a <strong>digital city</strong>) transmitting data using wireless technology and the cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cloud-based IoT applications receive, analyze, and manage data in real-time to help municipalities, enterprises, and citizens make better decisions that improve quality of life.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Citizens</strong> engage with smart city ecosystems in various ways using smartphones and mobile devices and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/connect-cars" title="Thales Automotive Connectivity" target="_blank">connected cars</a> and homes. Pairing devices and data with a city’s physical infrastructure and services can cut costs and improve sustainability. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Communities</strong> can improve <strong>energy distribution</strong>, streamline <strong>trash collection</strong>, decrease <strong>traffic congestion</strong>, and improve <strong>air quality</strong> with help from the IoT.
        </p>

        <img src="https://www.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/gemalto/connected%20car%20(1).jpg" alt="Connected car" width="586" height="301">

        <p>
            For instance, 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Connected traffic lights receive data from sensors and cars adjusting light cadence and timing to respond to real-time traffic, reducing road congestion.</li>
            <li>Connected cars can communicate with parking meters and electric vehicle (EV)charging docks and direct drivers to the nearest available spot. </li>
            <li>Smart garbage cans automatically send data to waste management companies and schedule pick-up as needed versus a pre-planned schedule. </li>
            <li>And citizens’ smartphone becomes their mobile driver’s license and ID card with digital credentials, which speeds and simplifies access to the city and local government services. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Together, these smart city technologies are optimizing infrastructure, mobility, public services, and utilities.

        <h2>
            Why do we need smart cities?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Urbanization is a non-ending phenomenon. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, 54% of people worldwide live in cities, a proportion that’s expected to reach <a href="https://population.un.org/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf" title="World Urbanization Prospects" target="_blank">66% by 2050</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            With the overall population growth, urbanization will add <strong>another 2.5 billion people to cities</strong> over the next three decades.
        </p>

        <p>
            Environmental, social, and economic sustainability is a must to keep pace with this rapid expansion taxing our cities’ resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            One hundred ninety-three countries agreed upon the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda in September 2015 at the United Nations.
        </p>

        <p>
            But we all know how centralized decisions and actions can take time, and the clock is ticking.
        </p>

        <p>
            The good news?
        </p>

        <p>
            Citizens and local authorities are certainly more agile to launch swift initiatives, and smart city technology is paramount to success and meeting these goals.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How is IoT technology making cities smarter and better?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Secure wireless connectivity and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/customer-cases/why-thales" title="IoT technology" target="_blank">IoT technology</a> are transforming traditional elements of city life - like streetlights - into next-generation intelligent lighting platforms with expanded capabilities. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The scope includes integrating solar power and connecting to a cloud-based central control system that connects to other ecosystem assets.
        </p>

        <p>
            These solutions shine far beyond simple lighting needs. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>High-power embedded LEDs alert commuters about traffic issues, provide severe weather warnings, and provide heads up when fires arise, for example. </li>
            <li>Streetlights can also detect free parking spaces and EV charging docks and alert drivers where to find an open spot via a mobile app. Charging might even be able from the lamppost itself in some locations! </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Exciting stuff!
        </p>

        <p>
            But how does it all fit together?
        </p>

        <h2>
            What makes smart cities successful
        </h2>

        <p>
            In addition to people, dwellings, commerce, and traditional urban infrastructure, there are four essential elements necessary for thriving smart cities:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pervasive wireless connectivity</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Open data</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Security you can trust in</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Flexible monetization schemes</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Let’s break it down.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What’s the best wireless technology for smart cities?
        </h2>

        <p>
            The first building block of any smart city application is reliable, pervasive wireless connectivity. 
        </p>

        <p>
            While there’s no one-size-fits-all, evolving Low Power Wide Area Network (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/resources/innovation-technology/low-power-wide-area-technology" title="Low Power Wide Area Technology" target="_blank">LPWAN</a>) technologies are well suited to most smart city applications for their cost efficiency and ubiquity. 
        </p>

        <p>
            These technologies include LTE Cat M, NB-IoT, LoRa, Bluetooth, and a few others that all contribute to the fabric of connected cities. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The advent of <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/mobile/inspired/5G" title="5G technology and networks (speed, use cases, rollout)" target="_blank">5G technology</a> is expected to be a watershed event that propels smart city technology into the mainstream and accelerates new deployments. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But only with a few more elements…
        </p>

        <h2>
            Opening the data vault
        </h2>

        <p>
            Historically, governments, enterprises, and individuals have held their data close to the pocket, sharing as little as possible with others. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, open data is redefining the digital city.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Privacy</strong> concerns and fear of security breaches have far outweighed the perceived value of sharing information (see: 
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56168306" title="Google-linked smart city plan ditched in Portland" target="_blank">Portland and privacy</a>). 
        </p>

        <p>
            However, a key enabler of sustainable smart cities is that all participants in the complex ecosystem <strong>share information and combine it</strong> with contextual data analyzed in real-time.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is how informed decisions are made in real-time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Multiple sectors must <strong>cooperate</strong> to achieve better, sustainable outcomes by analyzing real-time contextual information shared among sector-specific information and operational technology (OT) systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            The conclusion?
        </p>

        <p>
            Data management (and access to this information) represents the backbone of the digital city.
        </p>

        <p>
            Stay with us. Here is what we mean.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Can smart cities be secured and trusted?
        </h2>

        <p>
            In digital cities, connected cameras, intelligent road systems, and public safety monitoring systems can provide an added layer of protection and emergency support to aid citizens when needed. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>But what about protecting smart cities themselves from vulnerabilities? </li>
            <li>How can we defend against hacking, cyber-attacks, and data 
            theft? </li>
            <li>In cities where multiple participants share information, how do we trust that participants are who they say they are? </li>
            <li>And how do we know the data they report is true and accurate? </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The answers lie in physical data vaults and strong authentication and ID management solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Smart cities can only work if we can trust them. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Four core security objectives for smart city solutions
        </h3>

        <p>
            All ecosystem partners - governments, enterprises, software providers, device manufacturers, energy providers, and network service providers - must do their part and integrate solutions that abide by four core security objectives:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Availability:</strong> Without actionable, real-time, and reliable data access, the smart city can’t thrive. How information is collected, distilled, and shared is critical, and security solutions must avoid adverse effects on availability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integrity:</strong> Smart cities depend on reliable and accurate data. Measures must be taken to ensure that data is accurate and free from manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Some of the data collected, stored, and analyzed will include sensitive details about consumers themselves. Steps must be taken to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Accountability:</strong> Users of a system must be responsible for their actions. Their interactions with sensitive systems should be logged and associated with a specific user. These logs should be difficult to forge and have reliable integrity protection.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Strong authentication and ID management solutions must be integrated into the ecosystem to ensure that data is shared only with authorized parties to achieve these security core objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            The solutions also protect backend systems from intrusion and hacking. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Thankfully, legislation is being introduced to address threats and potential market failure due to growing digital security concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1691/text?format=txt" title="Bill">IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act in the U.S.</a> signed on 4 December 2020, or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/uks-iot-security-by-design-law-will-cover-smartphones-too/" title="UK’s IoT ‘security by design’ law will cover smartphones too" target="_blank">UK IoT security law</a> (not passed yet in June 2021), legislations will help establish minimum security requirements for connected devices.
        </p>
